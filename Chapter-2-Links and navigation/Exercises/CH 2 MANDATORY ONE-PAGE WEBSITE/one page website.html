        <!-- paragragh with a common class to customize  -->
        <p class="sectionpara">'Brave Citizen', a South Korean film released in 2023, is a
            story follows the main character, So Si-min, a former female boxing champion who works
            as a contract high school teacher at Mooyoung High. In the movie, Mooyoung High is portrayed
            as an 'exemplary anti-bullying school' in the eyes of the public, when in reality it's the exact opposite.
            Early into the movie and So Si-min's job, she finds out the overwhelming truth about the bullying that takes 
            place in the high school, which had caused a lot of previous contract teachers to end their lives. This leads 
            us to our main antagonist, Han Su-kang. Wealthy, protected, and severely feared by the students and the faculty,
            Su-kang and his crew face no consequences when they harass and bully students for their entertainment. Not wanting
            to lose her job but unable to let injustice slide, the former boxing champion disguises herself as a man with a cat
            mask and teaches Su-kang a lesson everyone secretly yearned for, becoming a hero in Mooyoung High.

        <!-- paragragh with a class used to customize it to make it look like a review box -->
        <p class="reviews">Bounding Into Comics: 

            "Brave Citizen digs deep into the bullying aspect of the storyline.
            Feeling dread and hopelessness makes Si-min’s
            gradual transition into a masked hero even more satisfying.
            The film is a hard watch overall, but a rewarding one with 
            slight jabs at comedy."

            "Brave Citizen is my favorite film from the first week of Fantasia 2024.
            I went in with no real expectations, only to discover an action gem."
