        <p class="reviews">Bounding Into Comics: 

            "Brave Citizen digs deep into the bullying aspect of the storyline.
            Feeling dread and hopelessness makes Si-min’s
            gradual transition into a masked hero even more satisfying.
            The film is a hard watch overall, but a rewarding one with 
            slight jabs at comedy."

            "Brave Citizen is my favorite film from the first week of Fantasia 2024.
            I went in with no real expectations, only to discover an action gem."
