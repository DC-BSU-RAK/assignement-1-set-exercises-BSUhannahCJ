        <p class="sectionpara">'Brave Citizen', a South Korean film released in 2023, is a
            story follows the main character, So Si-min, a former female boxing champion who works
            as a contract high school teacher at Mooyoung High. In the movie, Mooyoung High is portrayed
            as an 'exemplary anti-bullying school' in the eyes of the public, when in reality it's the exact opposite.
            Early into the movie and So Si-min's job, she finds out the overwhelming truth about the bullying that takes 
            place in the high school, which had caused a lot of previous contract teachers to end their lives. This leads 
            us to our main antagonist, Han Su-kang. Wealthy, protected, and severely feared by the students and the faculty,
            Su-kang and his crew face no consequences when they harass and bully students for their entertainment. Not wanting
            to lose her job but unable to let injustice slide, the former boxing champion disguises herself as a man with a cat
            mask and teaches Su-kang a lesson everyone secretly yearned for, becoming a hero in Mooyoung High.
